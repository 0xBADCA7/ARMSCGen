### Shellcodes for ARM/Thumb mode

Ideas came from [shell-storm](http://www.shell-storm.org) and [pwntools/pwnies](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools).

Thanks to share all of brilliant sources on the net.

I'm interested in mobile platform and archtecture like Android on ARM, Router on MIPS and so on.

This project named ARMSCGen focus on shellcode on ARM Architech especially ARMv7 Thumb Mode.

### Requirement

Cross Compile Tool for ARM

``as``, ``ld`` and ``objcopy``

### Installation

``python setup.py install``

### Usage

reads ``examples`` directory

### TODO

``AArch64`` shellcodes

``AArch32-ARM Mode`` shellcodes

(To be continued)
